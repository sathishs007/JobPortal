								<b>MyJobKart.com Security Advice</b>
							</h3>
						</center>
						MyJobKart.com is a platform that brings together Jobseekers and
						Employers. We are neither a recruitment firm nor do we act as
						labor consultants to, or employment partners of, any employer. The
						portal is used by numerous corporate, placement companies, and
						recruitment firms. The usage of our site is bound by a set of
						terms and conditions that the employers must agree and adhere to.
						One of the primary objectives of these Terms and Conditions is to
						discourage and prevent misuse and fraud.<br /> <br />
						Regrettably, sometimes, false job postings are listed online, and
						non-existing job offers are sent via email to illegally collect
						personal information and/or money from unsuspecting job seekers.
						To tackle such cases, we need your help to remain vigilant every
						day - when we receive complaints from jobseekers about fraudulent
						or suspicious emails, we promptly notify the concerned employer
						and, if necessary, block them from using our services.<br /> <br />
						<h4>
							<b>We encourage you to be wary of emails that</b>
						</h4>
					1.ask your
						personal, non-work related information such as Credit Card numbers
						or Bank information over phone or email<br />
						2.do not provide
						valid contact information<br />
						3.ask for monetary transactions, money-transfers, or payment for
						any employment/recruitment related purpose<br />
						4.promise emigration and ask for money to process visa, etc<br />
						Before you respond to such emails, <b>we suggest you to do a
							discreet enquiry and be sure to verify the legitimacy of the
							employer</b> with whom you are interacting. Please note that
						MyJobKart.com does not approve of, or represent any employer or
						recruiter sending such fraudulent communication, which in fact are
						a violation of the Terms and Conditions. We value the trust you
						place on MyJobKart.com and are committed to making your job
						search a safe and fraud-free experience on our site.<br /> <br />
						If you have received (or receive) any such suspicious email
						communication from a possible MyJobKart client, do report it to
						us at compliance@MyJobKart.com.<br /> <br />
						<h4>
							<b>Educate yourself against Fraud/Scams</b>
						</h4>
						We encourage you to read the following and make yourself aware of
						the warning signs of the most common kinds of Internet and Email
						frauds.<br />There are two types of email scams "phishing" and
						"spoofing". In both the cases, the "from address" is forged to
						make it appear as if it came from a source that it actually did
						not come from.<br /> <br />
						<h4>
							<b>What is Phishing?</b>
						</h4>
						Phishing is an attempt by fraudsters to 'fish' for your personal
						details. A phishing attempt is usually in the form of an e-mail,
						which encourages you to click a link that takes you to a
						fraudulent log-on page designed to capture your
						account/password/personal details. These emails can also be used
						to lure the recipient into downloading harmful software. Please
						note that MyJobKart.com will never ask you to download software
						in order to access your account. More information about Phishing
						scams and how you can protect yourself against them is available
						here<br /> <a>http://www.antiphishing.org/resources/overview/</a><br />
						<h4>
							<b>What is Spoofing?</b>
						</h4>
						Spoof emails usually include a fraudulent offer of employment
						and/or an invitation to perform a monetary transaction. Such email
						scams are, unfortunately, common across the world and could target
						anyone - including unsuspecting jobseekers who have registered
						with MyJobKart.com. The sender address is often disguised and/or
						the sender may not have provided the entire contact information,
						such as, the correct physical address, phone numbers and email ID.<br />
						The precautionary measures jobseekers could take to protect
						themselves against suspected spoof emails have been mentioned
						above.<br />
						<h5>
							<b>How can you check if an employer or a recruiter is a fraud
								or genuine?</b>
						</h5>
						Below are a few things we can suggest you could try (you are
						encouraged to exhaust all possible ways, not just be limited to
						the following) to ascertain the legitimacy of the employers who
						contact you:<br />1.Have you heard the name of the company
						before?<br />2.Do you remember applying to this particular
						company or did the offer come unsolicited?<br />3.Does the domain
						name in their email address match the name of the company? For
						example if you get a job offer from XYZ Petroleum Company, and
						their email ID is xyzpetroleum@gmail.com or xyzpetroleum@yahoo.com
						then it is a fake company. Real companies use their own domain
						name on their email, and do not use free email providers.<br />4.Search
						on Yahoo, Google or MSN to see if the company has a genuine
						website. Also check if other people have reported that the
						employer has been involved in job scams previously.<br />5.Note
						the country that company claims to be working in, and offering you
						a job in. Most fake companies offer scam jobs in Africa, Middle
						East, Asia, South America, and to a much smaller extent, US or
						Western Europe.<br />6.Find out if you need to pay the company
						for anything. If they ask you to pay - at first or even after some
						time - for visa, work permit or for travel, chances are it's a
						fake company.<br /> <br /> Remember, If you have received (or
						receive) any such suspicious email communication from a possible
						MyJobKart client, do not hesitate to report it to us at
						compliance@MyJobKart.com. You can also block the employer from
						contacting you in future, from your Account Settings.
